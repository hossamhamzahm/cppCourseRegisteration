# cppCourseRegisteration
This is a course registration system written completely in c++. The main algorithm used in the project is the BFS Topological Sort in order to traverse the graph that consists of the courses (the adjacency list containing all the courses). The Topological Sort algorithm ensures that no course will be registered without its prerequisites.
